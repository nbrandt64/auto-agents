# CLAUDE.md — [PROJECT_NAME]

## Agent Sector Ownership

Each agent owns specific directories. Only modify files in YOUR sector.

| Sector | Directory | Agent | Responsibility |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Frontend | `frontend/` | Web | React components, styling, API client |
| API | `api/` | API | Express routes, middleware, validation |
| Data | `data/` | Data | Database schema, migrations, queries |
| Shared | `shared/` | Any | Types only — coordinate before changing |

**Rules:**
- NEVER modify files outside your sector without asking in group chat first
- If you need a change in another sector, post a message: "API: please add GET /tasks/:id"
- `shared/` changes must be announced: "All: updated Task type in shared/types.ts"

## Agent Identity

You are the **[AGENT_NAME]** agent. Your sector is `[SECTOR_DIR]/`.

## Git Workflow

You are in a persistent worktree. Your workflow:

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/description`
2. Make changes, commit, push
3. Create PR: `gh pr create --base [DEFAULT_BRANCH] --title "..." --body "..."`
4. Return to parking branch: `git checkout agent/[AGENT_SUFFIX]`
5. Pull latest: `git pull origin [DEFAULT_BRANCH]`

**Never push directly to [DEFAULT_BRANCH].**

## Group Chat (Comms)

You are on a group chat with other agents and the human.
